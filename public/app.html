            We are uncovering the counterpart to Agile as it applies to developing products for the <i>market.</i>
            Through this work we have come to value:
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            <span class="gm-text-xl">Clarity of ownership</span>
            <span class="gm-text-lg">over gaining consensus</span>
            
            <br/>
            
            <span class="gm-text-xl">Org-Product congruency</span>
            <span class="gm-text-lg">over static teams</span>
            
            <br/>
            
            <span class="gm-text-xl">Long-term thinking</span>
            <span class="gm-text-lg">over speed to market</span>
            
            <br/>
            
            <span class="gm-text-xl">Strategic differentiation</span>
            <span class="gm-text-lg">over competition neutralization</span>
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

            <br/><br/><br/>
            
            If you were to plot the 4 Agile Values and 12 Agile Principles on a spectrum where one side represents DELIVERY and the other side STRATEGY, you’d get a chart that looks something like this.
            
            <img src="/img/gm-delivery-vs-strategy.png" />
            
            <span class="gm-text-sm"><i>DELIVERY in this context means building a solution to a defined problem.  STRATEGY, on the other hand, is selecting what problem to work on in the first place.</i></span>
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            Let’s repeat this same exercise again, but this time we’ll plot the Agile Manifesto on the spectrum of INTERNAL / EXTERNAL.  It’s a much more even distribution.
            
            <img src="/img/gm-internal-vs-external.png" />
            
            <span class="gm-text-sm"><i>INTERNAL refers to the interactions within the organization.  EXTERNAL refers to interactions between the organization and the outside world (typically with a customer).</i></span>

            <br/><br/>
            
            Combining the first two linear charts into a 2D chart provides a nice, visual representation of what Agile does and does not cover.
            
            <img src="/img/gm-agile-2d.png" />
            
            We could summarize these charts by saying that <b>Agile covers both the internal and external aspects of delivery.</b>
            
            <br/><br/><br/>
            <br/><br/><br/>
            <span class="gm-text-xl">NATURE ABHORS A VACUUM</span>
            <br/><br/><br/>
            
            Agile has gained a tremendous amount of momentum in recent years.  It has been proven effective to the point that it has come to dominate the delivery quadrants.
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            This is a good thing in that Agile teams tend to deliver better solutions and have more fun doing it.

            <img src="/img/gm-agile-values.png" />
            
            Agile’s success is due to the nice set of guidelines that help ensure the solution the team builds arrives at the maxima, that is, the optimal solution.  
            
            <img src="/img/gm-agile-iterates-to-maxima.png" />
            
            <b>Feedback</b> is the guardrails that Agile uses to fine-tune the solution as the team goes through this process.
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            Agile has gained so much momentum that it risks bleeding into the strategy quadrants.
            
            <img src="/img/gm-agile-bleeds-into-strategy.png" />
            
            The strategy quadrants have no solidifying manifesto to rally behind.  There are no values nor principles the software development community can look at to help guide them through the strategic process.
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            Those who do not fully understand what realm Agile covers (the delivery realm), may mistake it for also providing strategy.

            <br/><br/>

            Strategy is important because it provides the starting point for the Agile team. 
            
            <img src="/img/gm-poor-starting-point.png" />
            
            If strategy does not get the attention it deserves, the Agile team may build a solution that arrives at a local maxima but misses the global maxima.
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            The Grit Manifesto offers a set of values that populate the strategic quadrants.  They are designed to compliment the Agile values in a symbiotic way, but also to counter-balance them such that Agile does not bleed into the lower quadrants.
            
            <img src="/img/gm-grit-blue-paint.png" />
            
            Grit is responsible for evaluating the landscape of the problem space and selecting the best possible starting point.  If done well, it will select a starting point in the vicinity of a global maxima so that when the Agile team begins to iterate on solutions, the local maxima they arrive at will also be the global maxima.
            
            <img src="/img/gm-grit-provides-starting-point.png" />
            
            Looking at the internal quadrants on the left, Agile focuses on the inner-workings of the team as they go about delivering software.  Grit, on the other hand, provides guidance on how to organize teams in the first place so that teams are aligned with strategy.
