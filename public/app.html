I don't know why. Because they're harder. They're much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you've completely failed.</span></div>

                <div class="quote"><span>Even in engineering-driven Silicon Valley, the buzzwords of the moment call for building a “lean startup” that can “adapt” and “evolve” to an ever-changing environment. Would-be entrepreneurs are told that nothing can be known in advance: we’re supposed to listen to what customers say they want, make nothing more than a “minimum viable product,” and iterate our way to success. But leanness is a methodology, not a goal. Making small changes to things that already exist might lead you to a local maximum, but it won’t help you find the global maximum.</span></div>

                <div class="quote"><span>It's easy to forget, as a leader, that when employees don't get the wide view, not only does the point of their work escape them, but it can also lead to real frustration. It's hard to feel pride and ownership when you don't understand where things are going.</span></div>

                <div class="quote"><span>It took me a long time to figure out the central problem that Nietzsche addressed in The Birth of Tragedy. He sees two forces, the Apollonian and the Dionysian. One is measured, balanced, rational, imbued with reason and self-restraint; the other is dark, visceral, wild, untamed, hard to understand, emerging from the inner layers of our selves. Ancient Greek culture represented a balance of the two, until the influence of Socrates on Euripides gave a larger share to the Apollonian and disrupted the Dionysian, causing this excessive rise of rationalism. It is equivalent to disrupting the natural chemistry of your body by the injection of hormones. The Apollonian without the Dionysian is, as the Chinese would say, yang without yin.</span></div>

            We are uncovering the counterpart to Agile as it applies to developing products for the <i>market.</i>
            Through this work we have come to value:
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            <span class="gm-text-xl">Clarity of ownership</span>
            <span class="gm-text-lg">over gaining consensus</span>
            
            <br/>
            
            <span class="gm-text-xl">Org-Product congruency</span>
            <span class="gm-text-lg">over static teams</span>
            
            <br/>
            
            <span class="gm-text-xl">Long-term thinking</span>
            <span class="gm-text-lg">over speed to market</span>
            
            <br/>
            
            <span class="gm-text-xl">Strategic differentiation</span>
            <span class="gm-text-lg">over competition neutralization</span>
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

            <br/><br/><br/>
            <span class="gm-text-xl">AGILE'S REALM</span>
            <br/><br/><br/>
            
            If you were to plot the 4 Agile Values and 12 Agile Principles on a spectrum where one side represents DELIVERY and the other side STRATEGY, you’d get a chart that looks something like this.
            
            <img class="img-diagram" src="/img/gm-delivery-vs-strategy.png" />
            
            <span class="gm-text-sm"><i>DELIVERY in this context means building a solution to a defined problem.  STRATEGY, on the other hand, is selecting what problem to work on in the first place.</i></span>
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            Let’s repeat this same exercise again, but this time we’ll plot the Agile Manifesto on the spectrum of INTERNAL / EXTERNAL.  It’s a much more even distribution.
            
            <img class="img-diagram" src="/img/gm-internal-vs-external.png" />
            
            <span class="gm-text-sm"><i>INTERNAL refers to the interactions within the organization.  EXTERNAL refers to interactions between the organization and the outside world (typically with a customer).</i></span>

            <br/><br/>
            
            Combining the first two linear charts into a 2D chart provides a nice, visual representation of what Agile does and does not cover.
            
            <img class="img-diagram" src="/img/gm-agile-2d.png" />
            
            We could summarize these charts by saying that <b>Agile covers both the internal and external aspects of delivery.</b>
            
            <br/><br/><br/>
            <br/><br/><br/>
            <span class="gm-text-xl">NATURE ABHORS A VACUUM</span>
            <br/><br/><br/>
            
            Agile has gained a tremendous amount of momentum in recent years.  It has been proven effective to the point that it has come to dominate the delivery quadrants.
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            This is a good thing in that Agile teams tend to deliver better solutions and have more fun doing it.

            <img class="img-diagram" src="/img/gm-agile-values.png" />
            
            Agile’s success is due to the nice set of guidelines that help ensure the solution the team builds arrives at the maxima, that is, the optimal solution.  
            
            <img class="img-diagram" src="/img/gm-agile-iterates-to-maxima.png" />
            
            <b>Feedback</b> is the guardrails that Agile uses to fine-tune the solution as the team goes through this process.
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            Agile has gained so much momentum that it risks bleeding into the strategy quadrants.
            
            <img class="img-diagram" src="/img/gm-agile-bleeds-into-strategy.png" />
            
            The strategy quadrants have no solidifying manifesto to rally behind.  There are no values nor principles the software development community can look at to help guide them through the strategic process.
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            Those who do not fully understand what realm Agile covers (the delivery realm), may mistake it for also providing strategy.

            <br/><br/>

            Strategy is important because it provides the starting point for the Agile team. 
            
            <img class="img-diagram" src="/img/gm-poor-starting-point.png" />
            
            If strategy does not get the attention it deserves, the Agile team may build a solution that arrives at a local maxima but misses the global maxima.
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            The Grit Manifesto offers a set of values that populate the strategic quadrants.  They are designed to compliment the Agile values in a symbiotic way, but also to counter-balance them such that Agile does not bleed into the lower quadrants.
            
            <img class="img-diagram" src="/img/gm-grit-blue-paint.png" />
            
            Grit is responsible for evaluating the landscape of the problem space and selecting the best possible starting point.  If done well, it will select a starting point in the vicinity of a global maxima so that when the Agile team begins to iterate on solutions, the local maxima they arrive at will also be the global maxima.
